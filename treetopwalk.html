<p>Looking for a place to spend your time outdoors? Here’s one for the heartlanders.</p>
<p>The TreeTop Walk (TTW) is the highlight of several long hiking routes in MacRitchie that brings you through the different stages of a mature secondary forest. 
<br>The first of its kind in Singapore and in the region, this free-standing suspension bridge connects the two highest points (Bukit Peirce and Bukit Kalang) in MacRitchie 
<br>and offers a bird's eye view of the community of plants and animals that live in the forest canopy. The total length of the walkway is about 250 m and its height 
<br>from the forest floor varies, with the highest point at 25 m.</p>

<h2 title="Operating hours & Guidelines!" style="font-family:georgia;color:mediumblue;">Operating hours & Guidelines</h2>
<p>The trail opens at <strong>9AM - 5PM</strong> on weekdays & <strong>8:30AM - 5PM</strong> on weekends. The trail is <ins>closed</ins> on Mondays except during Public Holidays.</p>

<h2 title="Things to do!" style="font-family:georgia;color:mediumblue;">Here are the 3 things you can do there:</h2>
<ol>
<li><b>Hiking & Nature Appreciation</b></li>
<p><img title="Fishtail Palm Leaves" src="fishtailpalmleaves.jpg" alt="fishtail palm leaves" width="350" height="250"> <img title="Torch Ginger Flower" src="torchgingerflower.jpg" alt="torch ginger flower" width="350" height="250"></p>
<p>Be prepared to hike at least 7km as a round trip including the TreeTop Walk is about 7 km to 10 km (3-5 hrs depending on your walking pace). The terrain for
<br>for this trail is undulating with steep slopes at certain points. The trail is designed for visitors to walk in one direction especially while on the bridge. From the 
<br>suspension bridge, you can delight in having a bird's eye view of the forest canopy and try to spot different wildlife in their natural habitat.</p>

<li><b>Photography</b></li>
<p><img src="humanphotography.jpg" alt="man taking photo" width="350" height="250"> <img src="selfiettw.jpg" alt="woman taking selfie at ttw" width="350" height="250"></p>
<p>Enter the nature reserves and you will be wowed by the amazing biodiversity within. Stroll along the boardwalks and observe the wildlife with a careful eye and 
<br>quiet demeanour, and you might just be able to capture a few good shots. However, do note that the door at the end of the bridge only opens from the inside, so once 
<br>you're out, you can't go back in. So before you step out, check your camera and make sure you've got all the shots you want and are happy with all of them.</p>

<li><b>Bird Watching</b></li>

<p>Birds are hidden treasures of the nature reserve. Armed with a pair of keen eyes and binoculars, you will be pleasantly surprised by the number of species you can spot 
<br>along the trails. TreeTop Walk are great spots for bird-watching.</p>
